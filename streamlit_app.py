And give production or sales suggestions to the breweries in the different regions. Due to the increasing number of negative reviews and water army, the consumer would easily be affected by these grading. We would like to know if this phenomenon also happened in our dataset. Because negative reviews are generally random text, we intend to train the model using reviews as input and ratings as labels. Thus detecting malicious reviews and eliminating this affection.")
